# Texture Classification Using GLCM Features

This repository contains code for classifying textures (e.g., skin textures) as smooth or rough using Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features. The project includes Jupyter notebooks that extract texture features from images, train a machine learning model, and make predictions on new images.

## Project Structure

- **`first.ipynb`**: This notebook contains the initial exploration and feature extraction from images using GLCM. It includes steps for loading images, converting them to grayscale, and extracting GLCM features like dissimilarity and correlation.
  
- **`pipeline.ipynb`**: This notebook implements a complete machine learning pipeline. It includes clustering to generate labels, followed by training a RandomForestClassifier to classify textures as smooth or rough. It also covers model evaluation.
  
- **`texture_extraction.ipynb`**: This notebook focuses on extracting texture features from images using GLCM and making predictions for new images using the trained model.

## How It Works

1. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Images are loaded and converted to grayscale.
   - Texture features are extracted using GLCM (Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix).
   - Two key features are extracted for texture classification: `dissimilarity` and `correlation`.
   
2. **Model Training**:
   - The RandomForestClassifier is trained on the extracted features.
   - KMeans clustering is used initially to generate labels for unsupervised learning. Once the model is trained, clustering is no longer required.

3. **Prediction**:
   - New images are preprocessed to extract the same GLCM features.
   - The trained model predicts the texture (smooth or rough) based on these features.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-image`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `joblib`

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-image scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib
```

### Running the Notebooks

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/texture-classification.git
   cd texture-classification
   ```

2. **Open Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Run the notebooks**:
   - Open and run `first.ipynb` to explore feature extraction.
   - Use `pipeline.ipynb` to see the full machine learning pipeline.
   - Use `texture_extraction.ipynb` to extract texture features and predict new image textures.

### Example Usage

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import joblib
import numpy as np
from skimage import io, img_as_ubyte
from skimage.color import rgb2gray
from skimage.feature import graycomatrix, graycoprops

# Load the trained model
clf = joblib.load('path_to_your_saved_model.pkl')

def preprocess_image(image_path):
    image_rgb = io.imread(image_path)
    image = img_as_ubyte(rgb2gray(image_rgb))
    angles = [0, 1.0472, 2.0944, 3.14159, 4.18879, 5.23599]
    distances = [4]
    features = []
    for angle in angles:
        glcm = graycomatrix(image, distances=distances, angles=[angle], levels=256)
        dissimilarity = graycoprops(glcm, 'dissimilarity')[0, 0]
        correlation = graycoprops(glcm, 'correlation')[0, 0]
        features.extend([dissimilarity, correlation])
    return np.array(features).reshape(1, -1)

# Predict texture
new_image_path = 'path_to_your_new_image.jpg'
new_image_features = preprocess_image(new_image_path)
predicted_texture = clf.predict(new_image_features)
print(f"The predicted texture for the new image is: {predicted_texture[0]}")
```
